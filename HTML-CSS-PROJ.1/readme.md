# cusp sozzler words (solve this anagram :)

In the works :)
My friend had shown me the crossword puzzles found on The Guradians' website which was very fun to play so I had the idea to create my own using java and html as my first project.
I am using a guide before I go my own way with the task; here is a link :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEiykKEGBi0
I have completed the crossword puzzle in html and css. The next part is Java, abit early for my current project. or so I thought I created a puzzle with three words I will come back to this.
I have started following the love running exercise experimenting with a personalised portfilio web page containing videos and images from my gallery.
In creating my own video gallery I have followed this tutorial :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Y5gJWmVVU&t=666s.
I have styled my pages using :https://coolors.co/colors the image selector picked a pallette from my profile pic.
I have created a image gallaery following :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuJyYiRttpI
My first page is linked with all other pages I belive the website is now fully operatiional to be used as an online portfolio.
